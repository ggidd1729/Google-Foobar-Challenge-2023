During the months of December 2023 to January 2024, I completed Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera. In the introduction to course 7, I read the message contained in `challenge_message.md`.

I wrote my first bash script to decode it which is included here as `decoder.sh`.

The output URL invited me to Google's "Foobar" challenge, which I had a lot of fun partaking in.
